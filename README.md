# my-portfolio

This is a portfolio that outlines my passions, experiences and skills.

This portfolio has a nav bar and hamburger that a user can click, and the coresponding images of that particular category will remain on the page as the others will transition out of the page.
The user can then click on the images to be navigated to the page to learn about my experiences in that area.
This portfolio also links to my social and Github pages.
